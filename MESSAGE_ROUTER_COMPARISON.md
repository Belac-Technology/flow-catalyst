## Final Verdict

**The Java/Quarkus message router is the clear winner for production systems.** It offers:

1. **Significantly better test coverage** (80+ tests vs ~13 files)
2. **More mature architecture** with modular deployment options
3. **Enterprise-grade operational features** (K8s health probes, leak detection, incremental sync)
4. **Proven production track record** and ecosystem
5. **Additional capabilities** (Dispatch Jobs system, PostgreSQL integration)
6. **Lower long-term risk** (mature runtime, LTS support, large talent pool)

The Bun version is interesting and has some nice features (embedded broker, simpler deployment), but it's not yet ready for critical production systems. The lack of comprehensive testing alone is a significant red flag for production use.

**Recommendation: Use the Java/Quarkus version for production. Continue the Bun version as an experimental/reference implementation, but don't depend on it for critical systems.**

## Additional Considerations

### Migration Path
If you choose Java/Quarkus now but want to revisit Bun later:
- The architectural concepts are similar enough for future migration
- Message schemas and protocols can remain compatible
- Operational knowledge transfers between implementations
- Bun runtime will mature over time, potentially making it more viable

### Hybrid Approach
Consider using both for different purposes:
- **Java/Quarkus** - Production message router
- **Bun/TypeScript** - Development tools, testing utilities, internal services
- This leverages strengths of each platform

### Future Outlook
- **Java/Quarkus**: Stable trajectory, continuous improvements in native compilation
- **Bun**: Rapid development, but needs 2-3 years to prove production stability
- Reassess in 2026-2027 when Bun runtime matures
